During 2020 and 2021, the pandemic forced to work remotely from home in our projects and research, we adapted our regular meetings to be online. Lately, the university has allowed to enter the labs, so we started to assist and meet personally. With the funds we obtained this 2021 we have developed projects and bought some maker equipment like 3D printers (FMD and SLA), which we moved recently to the lab.
